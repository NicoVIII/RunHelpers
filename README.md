This is a library which should help by creating build scripts for your projects in F#.

There is no real documentation for this right now. You can have a look at the api
reference, at the dependents and the use in this project to get a feeling how this is used.

There are dotnet templates available to get you started:
```bash
dotnet new -i NicoVIII.RunHelpers.Templates
dotnet new <template-name>
```
